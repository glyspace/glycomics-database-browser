The GlycoDomainViewer integrates poly-Omics data sets and enables exploration and visualisation of individual glycosites on proteins from many organisms. We provide a visual representation of protein context around glycosites, automatically managing the amount of information that is drawn so that data remains comprehensible. The tool aggregates and presents data produced experimentally as well as retrieved from other databases, with a view to presenting the maximum amount of relevant protein and post-translational modification (PTM) information available to explore the possible effects of glycosylation on a protein. In order to focus upon protein context, only initiating monosaccharides are shown, with limited glycan elaboration (i.e. T structures).",

UniCarb-DR is the non-curated sister repository to the curated UniCarb-DB database. UniCarb-DR allows data to be uploaded as part of scientific publications, fulfilling the requirement for data open access. The current workflow for upload requires that MS settings and sample preparation are recorded organised in a MIRAGE form, as well as having identified oligosaccharide fragment data submitted as a GlycoWorkbench file, for which a template is available here.",

      "description": "The very first carbohydrate database was called CCSD, for Complex Carbohydrate Structure Database (1, 2). However, because of the tool used to access this database, called CarbBank, it is more commonly known as CarbBank. This database was initially developed by the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center at the University of Georgia. It was the first attempt to accumulate such data from the research community, and it thus became a valuable resource for current carbohydrate databases. Unfortunately, funding for CCSD ceased in 1996, but the data, consisting of almost 45,000 entries of glycan structures, annotation, and literature information, were still made available to the public.",

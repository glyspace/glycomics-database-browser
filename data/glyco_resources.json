The tool aggregates and presents data produced experimentally as well as retrieved from other databases, with a view to presenting the maximum amount of relevant protein and post-translational modification (PTM) information available to explore the possible effects of glycosylation on a protein.

      "The very first carbohydrate database was called CCSD, for Complex Carbohydrate Structure Database (1, 2). However, because of the tool used to access this database, called CarbBank, it is more commonly known as CarbBank. This database was initially developed by the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center at the University of Georgia. It was the first attempt to accumulate such data from the research community, and it thus became a valuable resource for current carbohydrate databases. Unfortunately, funding for CCSD ceased in 1996, but the data, consisting of almost 45,000 entries of glycan structures, annotation, and literature information, were still made available to the public."
